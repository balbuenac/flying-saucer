# Demo Applications #

We're linking a couple of demo applications for Flying Saucer that you can try without leaving the comfort of your browser. These will show you examples of rendering HTML using pure CSS so you can get an idea of the scope our our coverage for CSS (hint: it's good!).

All of these demos are available if you download our binaries—we're linking them here in case you want to launch them from your browser via Java WebStart. The demos are the latest versions for our current release.

**Note:** These demos all require you to have Java Web Start and Java 1.4 or higher installed on your system.

All of these demos run inside the JNLP sandbox.

## "Browser" Demo ##

A simple XHTML browser with scrolling, back button, link support, etc. This is not a "real" browser—but you can get an idea of how Flying Saucer can be used in a Real Application.

## DocBook Demo ##

Shows how you can render any XML as long as you have CSS that can provide layout information—in this case, a page of DocBook rendered using only CSS.
